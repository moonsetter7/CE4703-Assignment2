Hidden Deck:

    Face down on the table

    Players cannot see the cards in it

    Used for drawing when players can't play a card

    Gets smaller as players draw from it

Played Deck:

    Face up on the table

    Everyone can see the top card

    Used to play matching cards on top of it

    Gets larger as players add cards to it

Analogy:

    Hidden deck = Draw pile (like in Uno)

    Played deck = Discard pile (like in Uno)

They are two separate piles on the table - one face down (hidden) and one face up (played)!
